# marlisa-word-judgement
Judge which of the two utterances is the best pronounced.

This is not an experiment. The idea of this "experiment" is to ask from
native speaker to judge which of two utterances of a word is the most accurate.

## Trial
Each trial starts with two utterances of a word after each other. The task for
the participant is to judge whether the first or second sounds best according
their native language. They can see the word written while it is spoken. After
the utterances have finished, two repeat buttons appear for each stimulus.
Clicking them will enable to repeat one word. After they have chosen which
sounded best a continue buttons appears so they can continue to the next trial.

## Note
It is possible to divide the task over different sessions because the 
native speakers are about to hear many words. After each session the data for
that sessions is stored.
